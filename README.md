# Autonomous-Multi-Robot-Soccer-Platform
This project presents a heterogeneous multi-robot soccer system using ROS 2. Two autonomous robots with omni-directional and mecanum drives detect the ball and goals using cameras and an overhead camera for global observation. Navigation and obstacle avoidance are performed using LiDAR, while low-level control by Arduino via serial communication.
